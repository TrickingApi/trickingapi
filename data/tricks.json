    "description": "The Pop 360 starts in Frontside stance, leaves the ground off of both feet, rotates 180° in the air, then lands and finishes with an outside crescent kick towards the target and lands in turbo (both feet). This trick is also a hyper, because Pop 180 Hook (TKT) is not often used in tricking. This trick is vitally important for Illusion Twist and other similar tricks that end in turbo."

This move is often the first Shuriken that trickers learn, and is vitally important for future shuriken variations."
