    "description": "The Pop 360 starts in Frontside stance, leaves the ground off of both feet, rotates 180Â° in the air, then lands and finishes with an outside crescent kick towards the target and lands in turbo (both feet). This trick is also a hyper, because Pop 180 Hook (TKT) is not often used in tricking. This trick is vitally important for Illusion Twist and other similar tricks that end in turbo."
