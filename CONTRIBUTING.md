# Contribute

All contributions are welcome: bug fixes, data contributions, recommendations.

Please see the [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TrickingApi/trickingapi/issues) before you submit a pull request or raise an issue, someone else might have beat you to it.

- New Feature/Bugfix?
  - Write some code, fix something, and add a test to prove that it works. **No pull request will be accepted without tests passing, or without new tests if new features are added.**

Data Update?
- Create an issue under the "new trick" label, fill out the template, and assign it to yourself (if you intend to make the change yourself). Please use the [Corkscrew Request Issue](https://github.com/TrickingApi/trickingapi/issues/5 as an example! 

- Update the raw json-files in ```/data```
  - Tricks.json
    - **Do not update an existing trick AND add a new trick in the same commit**. These should be separate commits to keep things clean :)

- We'll accept your changes after review.
